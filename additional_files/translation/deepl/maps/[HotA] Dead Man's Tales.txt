===== Map description =====
This archipelago is known only to Regnans. A legend says there's a town deep under the isles, from where the portals can take you to Jadam or to Enroth; it's called the Crossroads.	...Erathian fleet was chasing the pirates, and they had to land on unknown isles. This time there's nowhere to run.

"Regnan frigates ARE the fastest ships in all of blasted Enroth after all! We shook them off good and had enough time to take a detour. We even managed to get a foothold on the island and take a breather in our forts.		These isles were meant to be our temporary base as we were heading to Vori Island over the Endless Ocean, but them Erathians managed to block the seas. Our plan B was risky; it involved fighting our way towards the Crossroads, an underground town. There are portals there that lead to Enroth and Jadam, some distant places many miles away from Antagarich and these isles. We will destroy them after going through, cutting the knights off. Erathians won't have guts to chase us on another continent...		There's a problem, though; some Nighon lord has made the town his personal crazy zoo. Heck knows what even brought him there, but we'll have to fight our way through. To make things worse, there are necromancers on the isle where you descend to the Crossroads.		We're lucky Tazar and his swamp folk tagged along - for a price, of course. Tatalians can barely fight, but their captain is very good.		There's a last resort possibility, too: to simply smash everybody; but we probably just don't have enough gunpowder to shoot every Erathian dog."

Message:
"We nearly lost them a few times, but were still holding on; however, they shook us off near the shores. I contacted the second fleet's admiral through my magic mirror, and the Regnans aren't there either. Them dogs know their way around the place, but this time it's going to be their own trap.	The land... These isles can't be found on any of our maps.		We had to seize the castles of local lords, but one Bracadan duke in the north offered his help fighting the pirates. He suggested the pirates landed here because there's a town below the archipelago. There are portals in the town leading to Enroth and Jadam. It was taken by some Nighon lord, and even though he died, the place is still thick with monsters. To make it worse, necromancers are in control of the underground passage.		If there really is a town down there, we must take it and destroy the portals, blocking the pirates' escape. Jadam and Enroth are quite far from Antagarich, and we can lose them if we don't succeed here."

"Coleshire mentioned that Bracadan mages who made the archipelago their new home created the "Ice Kingdom" - Regnum Nevis. We couldn't care less about those tall tales of the "great burg underground, standing on waters frozen, its walls like fine glass clear"; but there was a curoius part. The mages apparently brought titans here. A whole army of mighty giants, complete with their lightning bolts that strike from miles afar. We should search for that place, as titans may prove crucial to our campaign".
